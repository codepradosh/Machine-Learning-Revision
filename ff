Develop and implement an improved version of the TF-IDF cosine similarity algorithm that achieves at least a 10% increase in accuracy compared to the current model.
Evaluate and incorporate additional natural language processing techniques, such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, to improve the relevance of the recommended documents.
Develop and implement a feedback loop mechanism for users to provide feedback on the relevance of the recommended documents, and use this feedback to continuously improve the recommendation engine.
Integrate the recommendation engine with existing incident management systems, such as ServiceNow, to enable seamless incident resolution and documentation access.
Implement a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture for the recommendation engine that can handle large volumes of requests and provide high availability.
Develop and implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the recommendation engine using Airflow, to enable automated testing, deployment, and monitoring of the system.
Conduct thorough testing and evaluation of the recommendation engine to ensure that it meets or exceeds the performance requirements and user expectations.
